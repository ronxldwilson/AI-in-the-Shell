# 🖥️ AI in the Shell

**AI in the Shell** is an experimental project that gives a local AI model (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)) unrestricted root access to a Unix shell. The AI takes natural language instructions, converts them into shell commands, and executes them on the system — no restrictions, no holding back.

> ⚠️ WARNING: This project is highly experimental and should **only be run inside an isolated virtual machine (VM)**. Misuse can result in system damage, data loss, or unintended consequences.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Full root shell access for LLMs
- Natural language to shell command conversion
- Real-time command execution with output logging
- Local-only, runs fully offline via Ollama
- Lightweight Python Flask backend

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You send a prompt like:
```

Install nginx and start the service

````
2. The LLM (e.g., `llama3`) responds with:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y && sudo systemctl start nginx
````

3. The shell executor runs the command and returns the output.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Ollama (installed and running)
* A virtual machine (e.g., Kali Linux, Ubuntu, etc.)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-in-the-Shell.git
   cd AI-in-the-Shell
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask requests
   ```

3. Install Ollama and run a model:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ollama run llama3
   ```

4. Run the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python3 ai_shell.py
   ```

---

## 📡 Usage

Use `curl` or any HTTP client to interact with the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6969/run \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"prompt": "Install nginx and start the service"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "command": "sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y && sudo systemctl start nginx",
  "output": "Hit:1 http://... nginx is already the newest version...",
  "user_input": "Install nginx and start the service"
}
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* You must run this in an **isolated VM** with `sudo` access.
* The AI has full control — treat this like giving a human root shell access.
* Designed for experimentation and research, not production.

---

## 🧪 Ideas for Expansion

* Web UI with terminal-like feedback
* Command history and approval mode
* Live output streaming
* Prompt-based session memory

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and experimental purposes only**. You are responsible for the consequences of running code generated by an AI with system-level permissions.

Use wisely — preferably in a VM that you can restore or wipe.
